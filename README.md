# Regarding the 3 issues mentioned in the email:

1. I added a rolling total
2. To be sure, I divided 2 cases about the "Apply to all" feature. That is updated for all months and updated for the following months to the current month except the previous month
3. The function of pressing enter to create a new row in the sub category is that you will have to click on any cell in 12 months. And when inputting a value, it will not jump to the next cell anymore
